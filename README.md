# FOLKLORIC RHAPSODY | North Region Visualization
Visualization of one of the six regions in Bulgaria called North region.

This vizualization is part of a project called Folkloric Rhapsody which explores the rich and diverse heritage of Bulgaria by showcasing its six folkloric regions through multiple visualizations and interactivity, blending traditional culture with modern technology.

AI assisted code-based analysis of dances and movements accompanied by audio synchronization and patterns representation, uncover hidden relations and interconnections by giving us a chance to view different technologically based interpretations and create combinations of audience-generated patterns. The various outputs including printed informative posters, explanatory and data storing website, and the newly produced patterns projected on authentic folklore costume create a fusion of traditional and contemporary produced folklore elements.

Preserving traditions, customs and history while offering an engaging, educational experience that makes cultural elements more accessible and interactive – bridging past and present relations through creative experimentation. A possibility for further utilization as a comparative system between different countries' folkloric elements and culture.

For the visualizations and for representing each region video footage has been compiled where 5 are from the spectacle “The Bulgarian Folk Dance Masters” including stage performances of the best Bulgarian professional dance ensembles and 1 from “Adno Sa Ludo Izruka” performed by “Rhodope” Ensemble due to Rhodope region being more focused on singing performances and not participating in the first spectacle. Multiple camera angles and close ups allow for generating more pattern variations and analyse more the movements and positions of dancers.

Each visualization is coded with p5.js, JavaScript, HTML and AI assitance by reading the videos pixels and creating grid of patterns which size increases wherever the pixels are the darkest. The colours are assigned by reading the pixels of the imported colourful patterns images. The visualization is also audio reactive and synchronized so the entire grid moves up and down as a unit based on the beat and according to the audio amplitude, higher the volume, bigger the motion.
